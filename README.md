# Test Case Samples

Below there are some Test Case samples that I wrote working on previous projects.

------------------

**Description:**
Test the "Remember me" function by selecting it.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Go to www.website.com/login
2. Add correct credentials
3. Press "Remember me" button
4. Observe if user can login
5. Press "Sign out"
6. Go to www.website.com/login again and check if the credentials are already saved
7. Observe if the user can login again

**Expected results:**
User should be able to login the second time without the need to input the correct credentials again if he previously have clicked the "Remember me" button. 

**Test data**
User: user & Pass: pass

------------------

**Description:**
Test the Autocomplete search function

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Go to Search Bar
2. Write the first 3 letters of a product
3. Observe a list of products that match the first letters
4. Press on one of those products
5. Observe if the search returned the correct products

**Expected results**
User should be able to use the autocomplete function inside the Search Bar when entering the names of the products (eg: laptop)

**Test data**
